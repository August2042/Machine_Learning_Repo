## Overview

This repository contains code and visualizations for sentiment analysis on social media data. The analysis aims to understand the sentiment of posts, explore user engagement, and derive insights from the provided dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset (`sentimentdataset.csv`) includes information about posts, sentiment labels, user details, and engagement metrics. Columns have been renamed for clarity and unnecessary columns have been removed.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Folder containing the dataset (`sentimentdataset.csv`).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualizations.
- **`images/`**: Folder for storing images generated by the code.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation file.

## Data Cleaning and Exploration

The Jupyter notebook `data_analysis.ipynb` includes code for data cleaning, exploration, and initial analysis. It covers steps such as dropping unnecessary columns, renaming columns, handling duplicates, and checking for missing values.

## Visualizations

The Jupyter notebook `visualizations.ipynb` contains code for various visualizations, including:

1. Bar chart for User Distribution
